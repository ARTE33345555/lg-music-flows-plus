Welcome to LG Music Flow Plus – Artemsha Edition 🎵

Hi! I’m Artem, and I want to introduce my custom version of LG Music Flow Plus featuring the unique AudioShar technology.

🟢 What is AudioShar?

AudioShar is my own protocol for streaming music directly from your phone to your speaker.

No Bluetooth required

No cables needed

Works with a single tap via NFC

Music plays almost instantly — no waiting for files to download

Simply launch the app on your phone, tap it to your speaker, and tracks like Life is Good start playing immediately. 🎶

🔗 How It Works

Network Setup

Connect your speaker via Wi-Fi (automatic NFC/WPS setup or manual entry)

Or connect with an Ethernet cable

Assign Room

Name your speaker (e.g., “Living Room” or “Kitchen”)

Phone ↔ Speaker Connection

The phone and speaker communicate via AudioShar

Uses a one-time encrypted key for maximum security

No one else can intercept your track, MAC, or IP

📡 Streaming and Multimedia

The app has multiple tabs:

Home — your music library and recommendations

Streaming — Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music

Radio & News

RadioBrowser — hundreds of internet radio stations worldwide

RSS News Reader — listen to your favorite news out loud

You can enjoy music, radio, or news directly from your phone to your speaker without switching apps.

⚡ Features

Stereo Test: check how left and right channels are working

AudioShar activates in settings after updating to LGOS 2.0

Supports AirPlay and updated Chromecast

Fully secure protocol — triple-layer encryption with a one-time key

🚀 How to Use

Tap Next on the welcome screen

Connect your speaker to the network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
